‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó**WARNING**‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó CryoSamba is written for machines with either a **Linux** or **Windows** operating system and a **CUDA capable GPU**. **MacOS is not supported**.

‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó**WARNING**‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó These instructions are meant to be read carefully and line by line. Arbitrarily skipping lines/words or blindly copy-pasting code snippets will likely lead to errors.

## UI

From `Cryosamba/automate`:

```bash
pip install streamlit
cd automate
chmod -R u+x *.sh
streamlit run main.py
```

You can set up the environment, train models, make configs, and run inferences from here.

## Terminal

‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó**WARNING**‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó These instructions require you to know how to open a terminal window on your computer, how to navigate through folders and to copy files around.

Note: these instructions are designed for machines with a **Linux** operating system. For Windows, refer to the [manual installation instructions](https://github.com/kirchhausenlab/Cryosamba/blob/main/installation_instructions.md).

### Installation

1. Open a Terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to save the Cryosamba code via `cd /path/to/dir`.

Note: the expression `/path/to/dir` is not meant to be copy-pasted as it is. It is a general expression which means that you should replace it with the actual path to the desired directory in your own computer. Since we do not have access to your computer, we cannot give you the exact expression to copy-paste. This expression will appear several times throughout these instructions.

2a) If you received CryoSamba via a zip file, run

```bash
unzip path/to/Cryosamba.zip
```

in this directory.

2b) Otherwise, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirchhausenlab/Cryosamba.git
```

3. Once successfully cloned/unzipped, navigate to the scripts folder via `cd path/to/Cryosamba/automate/scripts`

4. To setup the environment, run:

```bash
chmod -R u+x *.sh
./startup_script_.sh
```

```bash
# In case of permission issues run the command below (OPTIONAL)
chmod u+x ./name_of_file_ending_with.sh
```

This creates a conda environment called `cryosamba` and activates it. In the future, you will need to run

```bash
conda activate cryosamba
```

anytime you want to run CryoSamba again.

In case of errors, try running `conda init --all && source ~/.bashrc` in your terminal.

### Training

From the same directory `automate/scripts`, run:

```bash
./setup_experiment_training.sh
```

The script asks you to enter the following parameters:

- Experiment name: it will create the following folder structure

```bash
cryosamba
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ runs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exp-name
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inference
       train_config.json
```

- Data path: it must be either

  - The full path to a single (3D) .tif, .mrc or .rec file, or
  - The full path to a folder containing a sequence of (2D) .tif files, ordered alphanumerically matching the Z-stack order.

  _Note: Ensure consistent zero-fill in file names to maintain proper order (e.g., `frame000.tif` instead of `frame0.tif`)._

- Max frame gap: explained in the manuscript. We empirically set values of 3, 6 and 10 for data at voxel resolutions of 15.72√Ö, 7.86√Ö and 2.62√Ö, respectively. For different resolutions, try a reasonable value interpolated from the reference ones.
- Number of iterations
- Batch Size

The generated `train_config.json` file will contain all parameters for training the model and will look like the following:

```json
{
  "train_dir": "/path/to/dir/Cryosamba/runs/exp-name/train",
  "data_path": ["/path/to/file/volume.mrc"],
  "train_data": {
    "max_frame_gap": 6,
    "patch_shape": [256, 256],
    "patch_overlap": [16, 16],
    "split_ratio": 0.95,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "num_workers": 4
  },
  "train": {
    "load_ckpt_path": null,
    "print_freq": 100,
    "save_freq": 1000,
    "val_freq": 1000,
    "num_iters": 200000,
    "warmup_iters": 300,
    "mixed_precision": true,
    "compile": false
  },
  "optimizer": {
    "lr": 2e-4,
    "lr_decay": 0.99995,
    "weight_decay": 0.0001,
    "epsilon": 1e-8,
    "betas": [0.9, 0.999]
  },
  "biflownet": {
    "pyr_dim": 24,
    "pyr_level": 3,
    "corr_radius": 4,
    "kernel_size": 3,
    "warp_type": "soft_splat",
    "padding_mode": "reflect",
    "fix_params": false
  },
  "fusionnet": {
    "num_channels": 16,
    "padding_mode": "reflect",
    "fix_params": false
  }
}
```

If you want to change other parameters, edit the `.json` file directly. In [manual installation instructions](https://github.com/kirchhausenlab/Cryosamba/blob/main/installation_instructions.md) we provide a full explanation of all config parameters.

To start training the model, run the command below from the same folder `automate/scripts`

```bash
./train_data.sh
```

To interrupt training, press CTRL + C. You can resume training or start from scratch if prompted.

### Visualization with TensorBoard

TensorBoard can be used to monitor the progress of the training losses.

1. Open a terminal window inside a graphical interface (e.g., XDesk).
2. Activate the environment and run:
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir /path/to/dir/Cryosamba/runs/exp-name/train
   ```
3. In a browser, open `localhost:6006`.
4. Use the slider under `SCALARS` to smooth noisy plots.

### Inference

From the same directory `automate/scripts`, run:

```bash
./setup_inference.sh
```

The script asks you to enter the following parameters:

- Experiment name: same as in training (should be an existing one)
- Data path: same as in training
- Max frame gap: usually twice the value used for training
- TTA: whether to use Test-Time Augmentation or not (see manuscript)

The generated `inference_config.json` file will contain all parameters for running inference and will look like the following:

```json
{
  "train_dir": "/path/to/dir/Cryosamba/runs/exp-name/train",
  "data_path": "/path/to/file/volume.mrc",
  "inference_dir": "/path/to/dir/Cryosamba/runs/exp-name/inference",
  "inference_data": {
    "max_frame_gap": 12,
    "patch_shape": [256, 256],
    "patch_overlap": [16, 16],
    "batch_size": 32,
    "num_workers": 4
  },
  "inference": {
    "output_format": "same",
    "load_ckpt_name": null,
    "pyr_level": 3,
    "TTA": true,
    "mixed_precision": true,
    "compile": false
  }
}
```

If you want to change other parameters, edit the `.json` file directly.

To start inference, run the command below from the same folder `automate/scripts`

```bash
./run_inference.sh
```

To interrupt the process, press CTRL + C. You can resume or start from scratch if prompted.

The final denoised volume will be located at `/path/to/dir/runs/exp-name/inference`. It will be either a file named `result.tif`, `result.mrc`, `result.rec` or a folder named `result`.

## Instructions for Setting Up CUDA

If it appears that your machine is unable to locate the CUDA driver, which is typically found under `/usr/bin/`. To resolve this issue, please follow the steps below after identifying the path for CUDA on your machine:

1. **Set the CUDA Home Environment Variable**

   Run the following command, replacing the path with the correct one for your CUDA installation:

   ```bash
   export CUDA_HOME=/path/to/your/cuda

   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   export CUDA_HOME=/uufs/pathto_/sys/modulefiles/CHPC-r8/Core/cuda/12.2.0.lua

   ```

2. **Ensure CUDA 11.8 is Installed**

   Verify that CUDA version 11.8 is installed on your system. If it is not, please install it according to the official NVIDIA documentation.

3. **Load the CUDA Module**

   Load the CUDA module by running:

   ```bash
   module load cuda/11.8.0
   ```

By following these steps, your machine should be able to locate and use the CUDA driver, allowing you to proceed with your work.
