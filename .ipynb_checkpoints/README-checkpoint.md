‚ùó**WARNING**‚ùó CryoSamba is written for machines with either a **Linux** or **Windows** operating system and a **CUDA capable GPU**. **MacOS is not supported**.

‚ùó**WARNING**‚ùóMake sure you have **CUDA** drivers installed and updated on your machine. CryoSamba requires **CUDA 11 or higher** to run. Refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for more support.

## Overview

CryoSamba can be run via [Terminal](#terminal). We also provide a [User Interface (UI)](#ui) implementation, which is currently **experimental**.

If you want to use CryoSamba on Windows, have a deeper understanding of the source code, change the optional parameters, or alter/use the code for your research, refer to the [advanced instructions](https://github.com/kirchhausenlab/Cryosamba/blob/main/advanced_instructions.md).

**Before trying CryoSamba on your own data, we recommend you first make sure it works with the sample data we provide.**

## Terminal

‚ùó**WARNING**‚ùó These instructions require you to know how to open a terminal window on your computer, how to navigate through folders and how to copy files around.

Note: these instructions are designed for machines with a **Linux** operating system. For **Windows**, refer to the [advanced instructions](https://github.com/kirchhausenlab/Cryosamba/blob/main/advanced_instructions.md).

### Installation

1. Open a Terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to save the Cryosamba code via
```bash
cd /path/to/dir
```

Note: the expression `/path/to/dir` is not meant to be copy-pasted as it is. It is a general expression which means that you should replace it with the actual path to the desired directory in your own computer. Since we do not have access to your computer, we cannot give you the exact expression to copy-paste. This expression will appear several times throughout these instructions.

2) If you received CryoSamba via a zip file, run
```bash
unzip path/to/Cryosamba.zip
```
in this directory. **Otherwise**, run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirchhausenlab/Cryosamba.git
```
These two options are **mutually exclusive**. 

3. Once successfully cloned/unzipped, navigate to the CryoSamba folder via `cd Cryosamba` and run
```bash
automate/scripts/install_cryosamba.sh
```

```bash
# In case of permission issues run the command below (OPTIONAL)
chmod -R u+x automate/scripts/*.sh
```

This creates a conda environment called `cryosamba` and activates it. 

4. In the future, you will need to navigate to the CryoSamba folder (via `cd /path/to/dir/Cryosamba`) and activate the environment
```bash
conda activate cryosamba
```
anytime you want to run CryoSamba again.

In case of errors, try running `conda init --all && source ~/.bashrc` in your terminal.

### Usage

From the CryoSamba directory, run
```bash
python run_cryosamba.py
```
and follow the instructions that appear on the Terminal window.

## Visualization with TensorBoard

**This step is OPTIONAL**

TensorBoard can be used to monitor the progress of the training losses.

1. Open a terminal window inside a graphical interface (e.g., your desktop computer, or XDesk).
2. Activate the environment and run:
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir /path/to/dir/Cryosamba/runs/exp-name/train
   ```
3. In a browser, open `localhost:6006`.
4. Use the slider under `SCALARS` to smooth noisy plots.

## UI

### PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEOS IN THE GITHUB (move_to_remote_server.mp4, install_and_startup.mp4 and How_to_run.mp4 to see an end-to-end example of running CryoSamba)

From `Cryosamba/automate`:

```bash
pip install streamlit
cd automate
chmod -R u+x *.sh
streamlit run main.py
```

You can set up the environment, train models, make configs, and run inferences from here.

## Troubleshooting

2. [General guidelines for different pixel resolutions](#General-guidelines-for-different-pixel-resolutions)
3. [Instructions for Setting Up CUDA](#instructions-for-setting-up-cuda)

### Setting up the data path

In order to use CryoSamba on your own data, you have to tell it where that data is located on your computer. For that, you will need to provide the path to its file/folder. That path can be an absolute path from your root folder, or a relative path from the CryoSamba folder.

CryoSamba accepts as input (.mrc, .rec, .tif) single 3D files or sequences of 2D (.tif) files. For single files, the "data path" must directly reference the files, while for tif sequences the "data path" should reference the folder containing the sequence. For example, use `path/to/sample_data.rec` or `path/to/tif_folder`. Not referencing the input data properly will lead to errors.

### General guidelines for different pixel resolutions

CryoSamba's fully self-supervised nature allows it to work on data at various voxel resolutions/binnings.

**In order to make CryoSamba work at different resolutions, the only parameter you have to change is the `maximum_frame_gap` for training and inference**. In our manuscript, we used data at 2.62 (unbinned), 7.86 (3x binned) and 15.72 (6x binned) Angstrom/voxel resolution, for which we set the parameter at 10 (20), 6 (12), and 3 (6), respectively, for training (inference). These values (as well as the 2x ratio between inference and training values) were empirically verified to provide reasonable results for our data. 

Since the impact of the frame gap can be verified only a posteriori, it is a time/energy-consuming process and we do not suggest testing it on your own. **For your own data, we recommend that you use a value interpolated from our empirical values**. For example, for data at 3.4A/voxel, you could use a value of 8 (16) for training (inference). Note also that the impact of `maximum_frame_gap` is not very noticeable over a relatively small range of values: for a 7.86A/voxel volume, for example, you probably wouldn't notice the difference between denoising at `maximum_frame_gap=6` and `maximum_frame_gap=8`. This fact makes this choice less "nerve-wracking".

As shown on our manuscript, **CryoSamba's results are more striking for higher resolution data**. However, high resolution cryoET volumes are usually extremely large and running CryoSamba on them might take a very long time. In that case, we suggest running it on a smaller, cropped region of interest (ROI) of the full volume. It could be a central 3D crop of the whole volume (since cryoET data is mostly pure noise far from the center) or a specific ROI that you want to investigate. For the latter, since direct visual inspection on the raw high-resolution volume is not usually feasible (that's why you're trying CryoSamba anyways!), we suggest choosing the ROI on a binned version of it and rescaling its boundary coordinates appropriately.

Finally, **we do not guarantee CryoSamba will work for resolutions higher than 2.62A/voxel**, as we only have tested it with resolutions up to that value. 


### Instructions for Setting Up CUDA

If it appears that your machine is unable to locate the CUDA driver, which is typically found under `/usr/bin/`, please follow the steps below after identifying the path for CUDA on your machine:

1. **Set the CUDA Home Environment Variable**

   Run the following command, replacing the path with the correct one for your CUDA installation:

   ```bash
   export CUDA_HOME=/path/to/your/cuda

   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.8

   ```

2. **Ensure CUDA is Installed and Updated**

   Verify that CUDA version 11 or higher is installed on your system. If it is not, please install it according to the official NVIDIA documentation.

By following these steps, your machine should be able to locate and use the CUDA driver, allowing you to proceed with your work.
